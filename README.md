# mpl

The mpl code takes a n x p data matrix as input and models the underlying p-dimensional probability distribution with a undirected graphical model
of (pairwise interacting) discrete random variables. The output of the code is a set of p * (p - 1) / 2 scores measuring the statistical interaction
between each pair of variables. More specifically, the scores are computed as corrected Frobenius norm scores
(see [Ekeberg et al.](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.87.012707)) from the coupling parameters obtained
by performing a (multinomial) logistic regression of each variable on the remaining variables
(see [Ravikumar et al.](http://projecteuclid.org/download/pdfview_1/euclid.aos/1268056617)).
We used mpl to predict chromatin-related protein-protein interactions
(details in our paper ["Epigenomic co-localization and co-evolution reveal a key role for 5hmC as a communication hub in the chromatin network of ESCs"](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124716000280)) and contacts located at interfaces of eukaryotic protein heterodimers (["Conservation of coevolving protein interfaces bridges prokaryote--eukaryote homologies in the twilight zone"](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/52/15018.full)).

This version of the code is no longer mantained, and is deposited here for reproducibility and to make it open source.
